# CiaGenerate
 - DSiWare, homebrew and retail CIA generator (cmd-line application)
 - You can see that in the source code there is just one "#include" definition (Opuka.h). That header contains lots of C and C++ tools, content and libraries, which are the include files I use to create programs at Opuka, which is my main project. When I publish the first version of Opuka (maybe on Autumn 2018, hoping to finish it before 2019), I'll create some repositories containing different parts of it. For the moment, its source code is private.
 # For those who don't know how a cmd-line app works:
 - Simply drag the ROM and drop it into the CiaGenerate.exe program. That will open the ROM with it, and then the program tells you what is happening. Simple to use!
